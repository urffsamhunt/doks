The story sets in Japan that developed a little different history from yours.

This is how a Japanese Princess relieves her stress of the day by using the latest VRMMORPG, and while playing the villain there, the first town turns into whirlpool of chaos, smashed the underground organization in one hand and went for a coup. It’s literally a playtime diary of a girl who is called as “Genocider-san”, “Roaming Last Boss”, “A different person plays the game”, “Raid Boss”, “Ruthless”, “Calamity”, and such by the players.
