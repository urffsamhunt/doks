# The Purer it is, the better it Blends

Author's Words :

 Happy New Year!

I hope we can work together well again this year!

By the way, right after the New Year, my home's water pipes froze due to an unprecedented cold wave, and I almost died (sigh).
 {{</ alert >}}

"Muscle power!!!"

Don't underestimate the power of the perverted gentleman's fist, which is unleashed with a spirited shout and the embodiment of destruction that he releases with his demonic expression.

This is because he is currently in a special state where his whole body is made of super-pure water. His body is a liquid, not a solid, and his muscles have swollen due to being continuously punched, which makes it equal punishment to those who foolishly attempt to dodge him by a thread.

"Gaboon!"

Just before the impact of his fist, the perverted gentleman concentrated almost all of the liquid muscles that had swollen in his body into his right hand. As a result, his fist, which had become significantly enlarged, extended forward with the momentum of the swing, and even increased its range due to the sudden increase in his weight.

This technique, which is the product of a very special body that is both liquid and muscular, can easily carve out the perverted gentleman's forward space.

"Ah, what a troublesome body."

"I agree. If we take that hit, we'll be caught in his water, unable to escape and suffer irreparable damage."

As they jumped and avoided the attack, Rena and the Absolute Invincibility Zone kept their eyes on the perverted gentleman, who had rearranged his fist without letting his guard down.

They had miscalculated the fact that the perverted gentleman had ceased to be human. Even though they had prepared countermeasures targeting a specific player, they were not inferior to other players or monsters and had the ability to immediately respond to unexpected situations.

However, physical attacks were almost ineffective, and even their magic, which was their specialty, such as thunder and flames, was useless against the perverted gentleman's impregnable and excellent resistance, which could be described as a steel wall.

In addition to this, there was his attack power, which was among the top class due to his ability to freely change his shape using his liquid body, and his ability to instantly recover from even the most serious status ailments and damage, which was unique to the priest class.

He was an "only one" class called the Sea God Priest, obtained by meeting multiple conditions by clearing world quests with the highest good karma value among all players. The perverted gentleman, who had obtained the title of "Important NPC" as the second player, was in a situation where various elements were perfectly combined.

Along with the enormous bonuses that had been applied to his stats, he was not a fortress that could be easily destroyed.

"Thunder won't work... "

"Even if we boil it at 100 degrees, it will turn into gas and be absorbed immediately, so it's meaningless."

"It's amazing how game systems and realistic depictions can fit together so well. I've really learned a lot."

While analyzing the situation, the Absolute Invincibility Zone thought, "He's a kind of achievement reached by players," and considered how to kill the perverted gentleman, while thinking disrespectful thoughts like "He's so creepy looking, I don't want to deal with him (laughs)."

Meanwhile, Rena came up with an idea of how to kill the perverted gentleman.

"El-san."

"Hmm? What is it?"

"Don't you want to dirty something that's pure?"

"I see."

With just that ambiguous conversation, the two moved as the perverted gentleman launched his second fist.

"Flashbang!"

"Shadow Clone!"

They scattered multiple presences around them with intense light, creating a moment of time to approach and close the distance at once. Even if it was just for a second, the perverted gentleman would regain his sight, and in two seconds he would probably find the real body among the many clones.

But that was enough--they only needed to get closer.

"Take this!"

Approaching the perverted gentleman in just two seconds, Rena threw a large bag right in front of him.

"Poison won't work on me now!"

"Even if one ingests poison or other toxins, they can be immediately purified.

Even if it were explosives, the damage can be reduced by using one's liquid muscles to moisten them.

Yes, the perverted gentleman who made a quick judgment throws a small punch at the bag that was thrown at him, but--

"Huh?!"

The gentleman's punch easily passes through, and what spills out of the torn bag is a large amount of--

"Do you know? Saltwater conducts electricity well? You learn that in elementary school."

Without delay, the highest level of inviolable territory lightning magic, "Rai Zetsu", is released--which would normally only cause some damage, but it easily pierces the body of the perverted gentleman.

"Gaaaahh?!"

What Rena threw earlier was a large amount of salt that she had brought to spread in the agricultural land and irrigation channels of a country dominated by inviolable territory...part of it, that is.

By adding more and more salt to the perverted gentleman, who is still being struck by lightning and unable to move, his body changes from a super-insulating substance, ultra-pure water, to one that conducts electricity easily, saltwater.

This is because when salt is dissolved in water, it separates into positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions.

In this way, when there are ions in water, they play a role in carrying electricity, allowing currents to flow...it's simply an application of a simple chemistry experiment.

"It can't be eradicated like poison, can it? By the way, the boiling point also increases, so keep boiling forever."

Due to the gradually increasing boiling point with each addition of salt, the perverted gentleman's body, which is being roasted by Rena's flame magic, reaches a state of constantly maintaining a temperature of over 100 degrees Celsius.

Considering the impact on the agricultural production of an entire country, the amount of salt mixed in is also significant...the boiling point rises steadily with each additional amount of salt.

"Ahh, ga...o, a...aa..."

Constantly convulsing and emitting smoke and steam from his entire body, the perverted gentleman's HP reaches its limit.

"I'm sorry, but I don't want to kill from torture. It doesn't look good, does it?"

"Is that so? I thought I looked lovely. It reminds me of when Mother gave me a windmill for the first time."

As the perverted gentleman, who is being constantly boiled at over 100 degrees Celsius and electrocuted all over his body, respawns after a grand and agonizing death, the two psychopaths engage in a conversation that is somewhat off-kilter.

 Author's note :
 
Monsters can be defeated relatively easily, right?

By the way, even if you want to try this experiment at home, tap water is not "pure water," the boiling point changes depending on the air pressure, and household table salt is not 100% sodium chloride, so it's difficult to observe the gradual increase in boiling point from 100 degrees. Be careful. 

And again, we received a lot of fan art!!
This is Lena from the cover of volume 2, by "Moshidashi Ganbaru"!!"
