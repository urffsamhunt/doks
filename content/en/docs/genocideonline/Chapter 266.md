Author's note:
 Sorry for not updating for a while, I was either too busy or my thumb got blistered and split from writing too much, so I couldn't update. Also, I'm sorry for the short ending to this chapter!

Next time, it will be a bulletin board chapter, so it will be quite long!

"What will you do? Will you continue?"

Despite knowing the answer, she declares it in front of me...a brazen fly carrying a letter from the homeland is waiting by her side.

I also received a letter from Fiilia through the familiar Thunderbird, saying "Come back, you idiot!".

"Just kidding."

"Then shall we have a ceasefire?"

"Yeah, it seems like the audience has increased, but we can't have someone like that gentleman getting in the way."

There is no longer any benefit to us rampaging around here.

Countless players and security NPCs are waiting around us, and above all...

"I never thought we would be burglarized."

Some organization called the Order Union, which apparently even took over our home country, attacked us.

I was excited about the idea of them doing something quite amusing, but I can't overlook it when I consider the reason why we were fighting here with her.

The most important thing in this war game is how to gain an advantage over the opponent from the start...so I tried to repel her, who would interfere with my plans, and then harass her country.

It wouldn't be fun if a third party took advantage of us without achieving these goals.

And above all, even if we continued to enjoy killing each other like this, it's certain that the players surrounding us would interfere.

They are just a bunch of people, not like that perverted gentleman who entertained us.

Rather than forcing ourselves to play while being teased by such people, it's better to take advantage of the situation.

"They also come up with interesting things, forming an alliance to become a deterrent force."

"I feel like the seeds we've sown have finally sprouted."

"Huh?...Is that so?"

I've already calculated that it's about time for them to get over the common sense, as they have been doing whatever they want until now.

The girl in front of me didn't seem to be aware of it, even though she had earned a lot of hate and attention, but I know there would be retaliations or counter-alliances.

Well, from her perspective, she probably doesn't recognize it as retaliation and just thinks "Oh, this person also wants to play together."

"...But well, it's frustrating to be obedient like this."

"Coincidentally, me too."

As she says that, she takes off her armor in front of me and the other players, dropping it into the shadows.

She's really defenseless...but I knew she wouldn't care too much about it.

I can feel the players surrounding us getting agitated.

"If you're with Kageyama-san, she'll take you there."

I see, she's going to use "Shadow Teleportation" to send her other body, the shadow familiar she sent to interfere with the other player while wearing armor, to the location. This way, instead of the weakened shadow monster appearing to interfere with the player, a nearly perfect one with full stats and armor will appear.

...Well, from an outsider's perspective, it's surprising to suddenly see her take off her armor and reveal a tight-fitting inner suit underneath.

"Well then, until we meet again."

"Yeah, see you."

She grabs onto a large, brazen fly that's big enough to carry a human and crawls out of her shadow, soaring into the sky with it.

Maybe because of the armor, the fly couldn't lift her up - or maybe it's because the number of familiars hit the game's system limit, but who knows.

"We'll kill you next time."

She releases the weak electromagnetic waves that she had been accumulating and holding back, and raises the output to electrocute the surrounding players and NPCs, laughing at them.

"Well, let's go back for now."

Next time, I wonder...maybe we'll expand out to the outside?
