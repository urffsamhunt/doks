Read the latest English translation of the Web Novel: The Failure Alchemist of the Royal Capital. 

{{< alert context="warning" >}}
I am Daisy von Preslaria. Even though I was born in a viscount family that produces excellent magicians, I was the only one in my family that was granted the failure job, Alchemist.

Since this has happened, letâ€™s try studying hard and become independent as a worthy alchemist!

The five-year-old girl resolved and began to make potions by trial and error. Thanks to her Appraisal skill that she secretly possessed, let alone misfortune, the finished product was of high-quality never seen anywhere!

She cultivated medicinal herbs, indulged herself in research, went harvesting, and opened a store.

This is a story of an alchemist living carefreely, sometimes fervently, while being helped by various people (by non-humans too).
