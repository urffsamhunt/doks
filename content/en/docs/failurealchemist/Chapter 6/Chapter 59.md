# Let's Make Fresh Cheese 
Since we got some safflower seeds, let's extract the ingredients from the seeds. Crush the seeds in a mortar and soak them in a small amount of milk. While stirring, pour in magic until the ingredients of the seeds are extracted into the milk.

Once enough of the seed extract has transferred into the milk, strain it with a cloth and let the milk with the extract sit.

The milk we normally drink contains an "acidic extract" that makes it turn into yogurt if left in a warm place for three days, so we won't need to add any additional ingredients to make cheese.

Put the milk in a pot and heat it up on a heating device. Add the milk with the safflower extract to the milk that has been heated to a temperature that is warm enough to touch with your fingertips (much cooler than a bath). Turn off the heat and let it ferment alchemically. When the milk has solidified to the consistency of pudding, cut it into pieces with a knife, with the distance between each cut being about the length of a joint.

After waiting a while, the liquid part will begin to ooze out, so heat it on low heat. Slowly stir the bottom and gradually raise the temperature to about lukewarm water. When the temperature has risen, turn off the heat and let it sit for about two quarters of an hour with the lid on.

After waiting for two quarters of an hour, the solid and liquid parts will separate, so collect the solid part with a strainer. (After cutting it slightly with a cloth, "Horo-Horo Cheese" is complete.)

Prepare hot water just before boiling and ice water. Put the hardened milk in the hot water, stretch and knead it until you get a texture that is soft and elastic like a necessary thread (it's very hot, so wear clean gloves or mittens and work hard while cooling it with water!).

After enduring the heat and finishing the work, tear it into pieces, round it, and calm it down in ice water, then soak it in salt water for a little while. Wipe the moisture away with a cloth, wrap it in a damp cloth so that it doesn't dry out, and let it rest for a day. "Manmaru Cheese" is complete!

Oh, the appraiser is giving me the following advice... let's mix half of it with cream.  
Spin the centrifuge around and make cream, then mix it into the "Horo-Horo Cheese."

"End of Section!" Just as I was satisfied and standing in a fighting pose with my fists on both hips, when someone from the bakery spoke up.

Mina, who had switched places with Marcus, came over and asked, "Daisy, is today's experiment finished?" While glancing around the lab with curiosity.

I showed her the finished "Holoholo Cheese" and "Cream Cheese" in cupfuls, as well as the three completed "Manmaru Cheeses" that would be finished tomorrow. "The 'Manmaru Cheeses' apparently melt when baked," I said, revealing the cheeses.

Mina asked, "Can I try a bit of the 'Holoholo' and 'Cream Cheese'?" with an interested expression, and I nodded in approval. After wiping her hands with a cloth, Mina picked up a pinch of "Holoholo Cheese" and put it in her mouth. "It's tangy and refreshing. It would be delicious in a salad," she said. Next, she scooped up a little "Cream Cheese" with a spoon and tasted it. "Oh, this would be good in a Danish instead of whipped cream. Oh, but it might also be good in bread if you added chives and garlic flavor... Can I use a little of this 'Cream Cheese'?" She seemed to have had a good idea, so I gave her permission.

"Wait a minute!" Mina left the room quickly and came back with a tray. On it were slices of "Fluffy Bread" that had been thinly sliced and baked again to make the surface crispy, topped with two kinds of "Cream Cheese." One was mixed with grated garlic and chives, and the other was mixed with diced dried apricots soaked in syrup. There were three of each.

As the two of us writhed in pleasure, Marcus, who seemed to have finished his work at the bakery, appeared. "Hey, are you two enjoying delicious food while leaving me alone to run the shop?" he said, complaining with his words but with a calm expression on his face. Our relaxed faces, enjoying the delicious food, probably made him feel that way.

"There is enough for Marcus too," Mina said, handing him a tray. Marcus took one "Cream Cheese" topped bread in each hand and took a bite of the chives. "Oh, it's delicious! I want to spread it generously on the 'Fluffy Bread' and eat it!" Then he tried the apricot one. "Mmm, this would be popular with children and women. It would be good with berry jam on a Danish."

The next day, the three of us held a tasting session for the "Manmaru Cheese" at dinner, and it was a huge success when it was baked and melted, and when sliced and put in the mouth, the milk oozed out.
