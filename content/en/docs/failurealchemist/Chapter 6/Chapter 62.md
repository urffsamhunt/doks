# First Metal Synthesis
"Well then, shall we try synthesizing a metal with silver and this gem? We'll need an alchemy pot, so let's go to Daisy's workshop," said Ana, hanging a sign at the entrance that read "I'm at Atelier Daisy. Please speak to me if you need anything," and then locking up after taking the silver ingot.

...This sign is all set.

But I feel warm that I'm being accepted as a disciple.

Then, we returned to my atelier across the street.

The bread bakery was bustling with customers trying out different breads during lunchtime. Some customers were eating bread and drinking iced tea inside because it was a bit sunny.

"Daisy-sama, welcome back, Ana-san!" Mina and Marcus, who were working at the bakery, greeted us.

"Daisy! Long time no see!" exclaimed Rethia and Mark, a duo of adventurers who fought bravely when the Behemoth attacked the royal capital, among the customers. Mark waved his hand in greeting, while Rethia seemed as blunt as ever and didn't seem to be good at being charming. Moreover, she seemed to be more focused on selecting bread than on our reunion.

"It's been a while, Rethia-san, Mark-san," I greeted them, and Ana joined in the conversation.

"Rethia and Mark. How's work going?"

"Oh, there's a request I want to take on, but it involves taking down a guy with a bit of a tricky abnormal status attack. I can't handle it," replied Mark, scratching his head.

"Well, if you wait a little longer, 'that girl' with Daisy and the blacksmith might be able to make something good," Ana said, winking mischievously at Mark.

...Huh? 'That girl' again?

"Oh, really? Then maybe I'll hang out here for a while. Oh, Ana, our inn is here. Let us know if you have any good news. We have enough money now, so if there's something good, let us know first!" Mark handed Ana a piece of paper and Rethia finished her shopping. The two of them disappeared into the crowded streets.

"Daisy, I made you wait. Shall we synthesize now?" I replied "Yes," and opened the key to the entrance of the alchemy workshop and opened the door. Then, Ana and I walked to the workshop where the alchemy pot was located.

"Does Daisy have experience using an alchemy pot?" Ana asked me, and I shook my head and answered "no."

"First, to make basic alloys, you put the materials to be mixed into the alchemy pot and pour magic into the stirring rod inside. That makes the metal incredibly hot, hot enough to melt. Then, you imagine the different substances mixing evenly and forming strong bonds," she explained, handing me a thick apron made of fabric and thick gloves that had been carelessly placed in the room. I put them on, grasped the stirring rod, and stood in front of the alchemy pot.

"Okay, put the Spirit King's guardian stone and silver in the pot," she instructed, and I carefully put the two into the alchemy pot.

Pouring in magic, it gets hotter and hotter...!

As I continued to stir the pot and imagine the substances coming together, the pot grew hot, the silver began to melt, and the air in the workshop became hot. Sweat started to bead on my forehead from the heat and tension.

Come together, come together...

I stirred the stirring rod, but when I looked at it with [Appraisal], it seemed that the bonding wasn't strong enough.

 [Gardinium]  
Classification: Alloy/Material  
Quality: Low quality  
Details: An alloy that contains the power of all guardians. The power of the guardians does not change depending on the quantity. However, the bonding is low, and the power of the guardians may not be fully exerted.  
Feeling: I want to hold each other tighter! 
 {{</ alert >}}

...Am I acting as a matchmaker...?

Hmm? But it says "hold each other tighter," right? I wonder if imagining that image will work?

...To be held tightly...

Unfortunately, I have no experience with men as I am just a child, so I continued to stir the mixing rod while thinking back to when my father held me tightly. Then, a strong light overflowed from the bottom of the alchemy pot.

"Okay, it's great that you can understand the feeling in one shot! "Ana patted my back as if to congratulate me. It seemed like it was completed!

All that was left was to cool it down slowly by opening the plug at the bottom of the alchemy pot and placing an ingot mold underneath it. Then, a liquid metal that shone brighter than silver flowed out into the mold.

"Now all we have to do is let it cool slowly!" Ana nodded, satisfied with the quality of the final product, which she was able to determine through years of experience.

 [Gardinium]  
Classification: Alloy/Material  
Quality: Highest grade  
Details: An alloy that contains the power of all guardians. Its corrosion resistance has been improved by alloying. The power of the guardians does not change depending on the amount of alloy used.  
Feeling: I will never let go â™¡

...But, is making alloys related to matchmaking or something?
