## Beastkin Village [5]

"...And so, the request we received has been completed..."

Mile said this while glancing at the faces of Rena and the others.

"That's ridiculous. It was a foregone conclusion!"

"Yeah, it's not satisfying to end it halfway like this!"

"If we capture more of them, we can increase the profits from selling criminal slaves!"

And of course, Rena, Mavis, and Pauline prioritize Mile's wishes.

It's unclear whether the ones they captured this time will be handed over to the human side by the beastmen.

If they intend to handle it themselves without handing them over, then of course, there will be no profits from selling criminal slaves, and of course, there will be no share of the "Crimson Vow." So Pauline's eyes were serious.

"I asked the village chief about it. This is the list of the children who have recently disappeared. According to him, one of the three cases was witnessed by two villagers who engaged in a fight with the kidnappers, but they were outnumbered and the kidnappers got away. Therefore, it was discovered that the other two cases were also kidnapping incidents."

"If they hadn't been witnessed, they might have been considered accidents, lost, or attacked by monsters, and it could have been delayed in dealing with it, which could have resulted in even more victims..."

Pauline reported the investigation results smoothly, and Mavis commented on it.

Certainly, as Mavis said, it was almost certain that there would have been more victims if they had not acted. After all, it seemed that these guys had the intention of resorting to force if they couldn't quietly abduct their targets.

And in that case, even adults would have been victimized. Either as seriously injured or even resulting in death...

"But, did they think it would be bad to show the villagers that they kill people who kidnap children, or did they think it was enough to escape with the children and didn't need to kill the witnesses...? Although they could have easily killed the witnesses if they wanted to, the villagers who witnessed it only suffered injuries and were not killed."

"Idiot, if adults are killed and children go missing, it would become a murder-kidnapping case. It could even become a major incident involving the lord!"

"Ah..."

Pauline's face turned red as Rena pointed out her own naivety.

"Besides, the phrase 'they're not such bad people, even though they're serial child kidnappers' sounds contradictory to me..."

And then, Mavis piled on.

"Ugh, okay, I get it, so don't be so hard on me..."

Pauline half-cried under the barrage of attacks from the two.

(In this world, where there are no photographs, it's not a big deal to be seen by someone, because appearances can change drastically with clothing, hairstyle, and whether or not you have a beard. There's almost zero chance that the witness is a skilled sketch artist. And even if a composite sketch was made, it wouldn't be distributed or broadcast on TV... That's why they wouldn't take the risk of killing someone and inviting serious human intervention...)

Mile couldn't remember people's faces at all in her past life, but now she could remember them a little. However, it was clearly inferior to that of an ordinary person, so Mile still didn't fully understand the "necessity for criminals to hide their faces."

They could just ask the captured guys directly about these things, but it wouldn't matter whether they did or didn't ask because they would probably say something appropriate to make the punishment lighter. Even if the truth were to be revealed later, hearing such "commendable things" wouldn't lessen their punishment.

"Well, anyway, for now, we'll go to the neighboring country and find out who the 'receiver' is that these guys are dealing with."

Naturally, there's no way those guys would be directly meeting with the boss. The dirty work, the dangerous work, is done by "those people."

"But the request we received from the guild only covers up to this point, and if we interfere with people from another country without permission, and if that becomes a problem..."

"We can't call it a request from this village anymore. If it's a free request that doesn't go through the guild, we won't be able to get support from the guild even if something happens. Also, not only us but also the beastmen who made the request will be in a bad position, and there's a possibility that it could become a big problem if things go wrong..."

"So, what should we do?"

Pauline and Mavis each voiced their concerns, and Rena bit back...

"No problem!"

For some reason, Mile confidently declared.

"We'll leave the job to another party, not us, the 'Crimson Oath.' A party of unknown affiliation, a mysterious party!"

"Eh?"

"The party's identity and the client are unknown. Of course, the responsibility is also unknown."

"And after a while, the three of them began to grin."

"Oh, that party...?"

"If we leave it to that party, we can rest easy."

"Yes, it's a good choice."

And then...

""""'Crimson Blood is Good! We're here!"""""

...from the depths of hell, the demons and devils arrived...

"...So, we came to this town in the neighboring country to meet the 'receiver' we heard about from those guys..."

"Well, those guys were careful enough to check the identity of the other party by hiring a specialized reconnaissance team and tailing them when they met, worrying that they might be cut off and blamed for everything."

"Yes, they're quite skilled..."

But that's what Mile and Rena were saying...

"If they were really 'skilled', they wouldn't be caught so easily or take such high-risk jobs in the first place! No matter how good the pay is, no sane person would take a job where they could lose everything and be ruined by one mistake!"

Pauline silenced them with a single word.

"Well, that's true..."

And then Mavis added her two cents.

"...Anyway, let's go squeeze that 'receiver'!"

"Yahoo!"

"Excuse me! I heard that you sell illegal slaves that you kidnapped here!"

Four girls shouted loudly in front of a certain shop.

"...What?! How dare you shout such a thing out loud!"

The shopkeeper rushed out of the store in a panic and yelled at the girls.

However, the girls calmly asked the shopkeeper.

"Isn't this the 'Airal Trading Company'? We were introduced to you by Mr. Veder, whom the company president ordered the foreman to hire. He told us that you attacked a village of beast people, abducted a young beast girl, and are selling her as an illegal slave. Can you confirm this?"

"What?! Wait a minute!"

The shopkeeper tried to stop the girls from speaking, but he was too shocked to do so. They had spoken out loud in front of the shop on a busy street where many people were passing by.

People began to gather, shocked by the outrageous story they had heard - an attack on a village of beast people, abduction, and the illegal sale of slaves. All of it was extremely heinous and a serious crime.

"Wait, wait, wait!!"

The shopkeeper was in a panic, not sure if he was part of the gang or just a low-level employee who didn't know anything.

And the four girls smiled.

((Grinning...))
