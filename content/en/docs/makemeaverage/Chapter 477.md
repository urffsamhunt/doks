# Annihilation [ 4 ]
"...Well then, please come this way."

"...Eh?"

The four of them, Mile included, were guided into the mansion after only a brief delay, without any expected ambush or encirclement from behind by the security guards who had appeared within the mansion.

(What the hell is going on...)

(Well, even if you ask what's going on...)

Their hushed conversation was meaningless.

(This is one of those situations where someone suddenly attacks from behind a hiding spot, or puts poison in the tea they offer, right?)

(No, it's also possible that they might use a paralyzing drug instead of a lethal poison to make us divulge information...)

((I see...))

The three of them agreed with Pauline's conjecture.

Certainly, it was only natural for Mile and her team to confirm who had made the request and where the information had leaked from.

Therefore, there was no need to cause a commotion at the entranceway, attracting the attention of the nearby residents, damaging the expensive building materials of the entrance, or destroying the furnishings, or needlessly injuring or killing the security guards.

The usual tactic was to let the enemy through, then invite them deeper inside and catch them off guard.

So, everyone was on high alert, particularly when passing in front of the door or turning corners in the hallway, they were tense and vigilant.

...Except for Mile.

Although Mile was also on guard, she had the composure that came from knowing that she had been using detection magic from the very beginning, which meant that there were no hidden attackers.

Then, the butler stopped in front of a certain door and lightly knocked.

"...I have brought the guests."

"Let them in!"

Although they were referred to as guests, they were uncivilized commoners who had come unannounced, and they even said something outrageous like "a slave beast-girl." Moreover, they were new hunters, belonging to the bottom layer of commoners. They couldn't be treated properly just because they were guests, especially in the position of someone like the Earl.

...Although in fact, he was "important."

It was impossible to enter the mansion unless they had some intention, but it was clear that they were telling Mile and her team what this nobleman was up to...

And what Mile and her team saw in front of them when the butler opened the door was...

A middle-aged man, who was big and fat and had thinning hair, sitting on an expensive-looking chair behind a large table.

And three men who looked like guards standing on his left and right.

Perhaps they had judged that it would be no problem as long as there were only two young girls and a couple of underage children fewer than 20 years old.

And perhaps the Earl himself thought that he could handle even a young girl alone, even if he let one slip away...

Even though he was fat, he was still the legitimate son of a nobleman, so he would have trained with a sword in his youth, and it was common sense that he had a hidden weapon somewhere, even if he looked unarmed at first glance.

"Hmm. As reported, you are all quite beautiful. Please take your seats."

Whether it was part of his plan to meet with them or he became interested in meeting them after hearing that they were young women, he seemed to have some intention of talking with them.

"......"

And so, Mile and her team silently took their seats.

It was a somewhat unnatural expression, as if everyone was pretending to be calm and composed.

Perhaps they were a little pleased to be called "all beautiful."

Even though he was a bad guy, if he truly praised them, they wouldn't feel bad as women.

Even if it was just a compliment with a base motive...

There were four chairs placed at the table, one for each member of Mile's team, with the one farthest from where the Earl was sitting.

When a human tries to transition from a sitting position to an attacking position, their movements inevitably slow down.

Also, because the table would be in the way, they wouldn't be able to slash straight at the Earl, and even if they tried to attack from behind, they would easily be stopped by the guards who were still standing on both sides of the Earl's seat.

...In other words, seating Mile's team would greatly increase Earl's safety. He didn't just consider the visiting commoners' feelings.

With full knowledge of the situation, Mile and her team took their seats.

"Well then, what business do you, new hunter, have with me, a noble?" the earl asked, ignoring their previous words at the entrance.

Pauline, as usual, took charge of the delicate conversation. She had a talent for speaking respectfully to nobles without getting into a fight.

Mavis, on the other hand, might have shown some noble-like behavior while conversing with the earl. Therefore, Pauline was the only choice for this conversation.

"I came to discuss the matter of a slave beast-girl that the Earl has purchased," Pauline said.

"I don't know anything about a slave beast girl... If such a thing exists, it must be important. But what do you think will happen if you come here without any evidence and say such things? Do you even know what you're talking about?" the Earl replied, trying to play dumb.

However, when Pauline glanced at Mile, the latter nodded slightly, signaling her to continue.

Mile was able to detect the presence of living things with her detection magic. She could even identify whether the target was human, elf, demon, or... a beast person.

Therefore, the signal Mile just gave was that she had confirmed the presence of a beast person in this mansion.

Then, the earl suddenly made a strange face and called out to the butler standing near the door.

"Bring Lilia here."

Within a minute, the butler returned with a 4-5 year old girl and a 6-7 year old boy, whom he held by the hand.

The boy wore high-quality clothing, while the girl wore a slightly less expensive dress that a well-off commoner child might wear. And on her head were two cat ears...

The team was confused by this unexpected turn of events.

Pauline hesitantly spoke to the girl, "Um, are you Sherry? Your parents and the villagers are worried about you. Would you like to go back with us to the village?"

But the girl shouted back, "No way! I don't want to go back there! I want to be with the children here!"

The team was left completely baffled.
