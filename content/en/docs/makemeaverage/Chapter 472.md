## Beastkin Village [4]

"Wh.. wh.. what!"

"What's wrong with you all!"

Just a moment ago, the beastman children were supposed to be frightened. But now, they were muttering incomprehensible words with eerie expressions.

It was natural for the men to find this suspicious.

"Yes, we are kidnappers..." (Kidnapper)

"We have received the utmost insult towards our bodies..."

"What is the verdict?"

"Death penalty!!"

These young girls were saying something dangerous.

However, despite the creepiness, beastman children around 10 years old (presumably) were like infants to us, who were accustomed to rough situations. Even if they were faster and stronger than human children, they were still just kids.

Thinking so, they tried to catch them and tie them up...

"Idededede!"

As the man reached out his right hand to grab the girl's arm, she grabbed it and twisted it.

"Let go! Damn it, are you a bear or something? Some idiotic brute force beastman! It hurts, stop, let go!"

The man who recklessly tried to catch Mile let out a scream...

"Damn it, if you don't behave, this kid..."

And the man who tried to grab Rena's collar...

Thunk!

"Gyaaaahhh!!"

His outstretched right hand was pierced.

...By a small hidden weapon resembling a senbon. (A big needle like weapon)

There was no reason for a mage to only fight with magic. On the contrary, it was common for rear support personnel who were not good at physical combat to have hidden weapons as additional means of self-defense, especially when refraining from close-quarters combat. Rena had rarely used the hidden weapon she always wore between her left wrist and elbow simply because she had never been in a crisis that required it, or even in a crisis where it would be of any use... except for opponents like ancient dragons, for example.

So when the situation called for it, she twisted her arm slightly, unlocked the fastener with a special movement, and could instantly hold it in her palm.

"You... Something's not right."

The men seemed to have finally noticed. The children who should have been crying out of fear were performing an unbelievable counterattack and wearing eerie smiles. If they didn't find this strange, they would be idiots.

"Drag them to the Sanzu River..."

"Exiling them to the underworld..."

"Sending them to hell..."

"We decree it!!"

Having been influenced by Mile's fake stories, Rena was able to deliver "a line she always wanted to say, No. 8" and let out a satisfied snort.

...By the way, Rena's "a line she always wanted to say, No. 1" is "Please, don't fight for my sake!" When Mile said that line before her, it caused quite a commotion.

However, since Mile said it to Wonder Three, which included Rena, and they were all women, the situation didn't escalate.

If it had been a line directed at a man, who knows what would have happened...

"Stop blabbering! All of you, jump in and subdue them together!" (Kidnapper)

"Oooh!"

Except for the leader and the two who had already been dealt with by Mile and Rena, the remaining five men attacked Mile and Rena together.

And then, Mile pushed the man she had restrained by twisting his arm towards them...

"Hot Tornado!"

"Gyaaaahhhh!!!"

The men screamed in unison.

The one who taught Pauline the Hot Magic was Mile.

And seeing that, Rena was also very interested in the magic that could incapacitate a large number of enemies in an instant with minimal magic consumption and without killing them. Of course, she learned and mastered it together with Pauline.

So, fueled by anger, Mile and Rena unleashed a double Hot Tornado attack, and the kidnappers, or rather, the slave hunters, were easily incapacitated and captured.

"So, these guys are the culprits..."

The "Crimson Oath" brought the captured eight slave hunters back to the village and handed them over to the villagers. Since they had already confessed to being slave hunters before being captured, no evidence was necessary. And even if they hadn't confessed, circumstantial evidence was sufficient.

... After all, the "Crimson Oath" was just a formal request designated by the guild to capture the targets and hand them over to the client. The rest was a matter between the villagers and the men, and the "Crimson Oath" was not involved or responsible for it.

And without the involvement of the human formal judicial institutions such as the lord or his subordinates, or the royal palace's judicial department, the villagers had the right to interrogate and punish them as they pleased. The beastmen were not bound by "human laws" as they were not part of the "human race."

Yes, being killed by beastmen was treated the same as being captured and killed by goblins or orcs.

And unlike goblins or orcs, the beastmen were not exterminated by hunters or soldiers, following the ancient agreement reached at the end of the "Subhuman War."

... In other words, they had free rein. There was no need for a fair trial, interrogation, or... even execution.

And of course, the captured men knew all about that.

"Well done. Now, let's hear everything about the kidnapped people, the buyers, and the boss.

Hey, is the oil boiling? Are the iron skewers glowing red?"

The village chief smiled and called out to the kitchen.

And in response to the cheerful "Yes!" that came back, the men contorted their pale faces.

"Gi"

"Gi?"

"Giyyyyaaaahhh!!"

And so, while eating oil-basted chicken and orc meat skewers in front of the slave hunters who had spilled everything, the village chief, village officials, and the "Crimson Oath" discussed the future.

Of course, no torture was being conducted.

What happened earlier was just the village chief checking if the meal preparations were progressing.

... After that, for some reason, the men started chattering easily, which was quite mysterious.

"It's really strange, isn't it?"

They grinned at Mile's words.
