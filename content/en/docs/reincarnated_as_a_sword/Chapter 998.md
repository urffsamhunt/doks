"Ugaa!"

"Velmeria!"

"Gaaa!"

"No good! They can't hear our voices!"

"Damn it!"

Even though Fran was calling out to her, there was no response from Velmeria. She was completely under mind control.

Fran probably intended to incapacitate her without killing her, but it would be quite difficult. Killing her would be much easier.

However, Fran wouldn't abandon Velmeria.

"...Fran. They have no reason and will come at us with all their might. We can't let this drag on."

(Hmm)

The current Velmeria was going full throttle without regard for her own destruction. It was evident that her life force was decreasing even before the battle due to the release of her latent abilities.

If they hesitated, they might die just from that. They had to either knock her out quickly or keep hitting her until she couldn't move.

I was watching the movements of the robe-wearing guy, but he didn't seem to be paying much attention to us. He hardly moved and seemed to be concentrating on something.

What was he doing with that sword? Was he interfering with the core? In any case, it couldn't be something good.

However, while he was focused on that, he shouldn't interfere with us.

"Haaa!"

"Uuraa!"

Fran activated his Senka Jinnrai and went into serious mode, but Velmeria also raised her gear to the next level.

Their speed was even, but Velmeria was stronger. Fran had an advantage in the reach of his sword. Also, the troublesome thing was Velmeria's evil aura.

It was emitting such a dense aura that one would think she had turned into an evil dragon. That wicked aura disrupted my telekinesis and interference magic, canceling them out. If I put a lot of magical power into it, I wouldn't be affected by the evil aura, but the consumption would be enormous.

The mind control and evil aura were the same as the dragon people who attacked us on the way here. Was it possible to subdue her? Or would they have to fight until they died?

Fran moved at high speed while firing off KuroRai, while Velmeria began to move faster than her, emitting blue magic power.

It seemed that they weren't really serious yet. No, they were probably pushing themselves even further to keep up with Fran. Velmeria's life force was decreasing even faster.

"Ugaaa!"

"Kuh!"

"Just one hit takes away a lot of my durability!"

Because the magic power emitted by the Abyss Devourer's core was so strong, they couldn't use teleportation. Therefore, they couldn't use an emergency avoidance maneuver.

Urushi couldn't hide in the shadows, and it was quite difficult to keep up with Fran's high-speed combat...

Little by little, Fran was spending more time on defense. Even in a state of holding back to avoid killing, the opponent was still too strong. Although her physical abilities had increased, her level of martial arts skills was still low, so Fran, who still possessed the Sword King's technique, was able to keep up. However, if the battle dragged on and exhaustion increased, the balance would be disrupted in an instant.

Before that happened, I tried to find a breakthrough by repeatedly appraising the situation, but it didn't work out. They were a higher level opponent, and the negative energy was interfering.

Still, when I used the appraisal with more divine attributes than before, I was able to appraise Velmeria for a moment.

However, simply repeating the appraisal consumed an enormous amount of magical power. But it was worth it.

To be honest, I couldn't see half of it. But I was able to confirm the important parts.

"Fran. Velmeria has transformed into a Divine Dragon after all! And it's through a skill!"

("Skill Taker!")

"That's right!"

When I took away Earth Rouser's madness, I knew that if I took away their skills, their transformation would subside. Although there were some worrying parts such as domination and negative energy infestation, there was no doubt that if they lost their Divine Dragon transformation, their fighting power would decrease significantly.

"I've saved this skill for situations like this! I'm going to use it!"

("Got it!")

I activated Skill Taker on Velmeria. As soon as the invisible arm of the skill touched Velmeria's soul, there was a clear sensation of taking something away.

"Uoooh?! It, it has an effect on me too?!"

Immediately after taking away the Divine Dragon transformation, tremendous power surged within me. Was this the divine attribute? Negative energy was also mixed in.

Apparently, the skill enhancement also worked on me, even though I'm not of dragonkin. Just like the frenzy transformation, if I take away a skill that's currently in use, it would become mine in that activated state.

'Fran! Urushi! Strike now!'

(Hmm!)

(Gaah!)

Fran's kick sent Velmeria flying. In her state without the divine dragon transformation, Velmeria was no longer an enemy of Fran.

Urushi followed up by attacking Velmeria, who was trying to get up, and I used my earth magic to trap her. Then, I used telekinesis to restrain her movements. She would soon be able to move again, but for now, it was enough to hinder her.

'While I maintain my divine dragon transformation, Isario and Frederick, provide support!'

(Hmm!)

(Understood!)
