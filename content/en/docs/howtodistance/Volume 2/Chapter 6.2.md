"Next, it's that couple's turn! Please sit here," urged the foreign staff member wearing a flashy aloha shirt. Rika and I moved to the waiting area.

As cheerful Japanese instructions were given, our tension gradually increased.

After finishing lunch, we took turns experiencing the water activities we had reserved.

We all rode the banana boat together, then Rika and I went jet skiing while Kyouya and Hinata surfed and Jet-skied.

Next up was parasailing, where we were pulled by a boat and flew through the air with a colorful parachute.

"Are you okay...? Like, falling or something?"

"I-I'm sure it's fine...probably."

We had a doubtful conversation while looking up at Kyouya and Hinata, who were already flying.

The two of them sat under a colorful parachute, swinging their legs and waving their hands.

"It's pretty up high... huh?"

"It's about twice as high as I thought it would be..."

I had tried applying for parasailing because Susami, who claimed to have experience, said "It's fine," but I wonder if I was tricked...

By the way, Susami is currently resting alone on land.

That girl..

While we were chatting, Kyouya and Hinata slowly descended from the boat.

Finally, it was our turn...

"It was amazing! It's so high up!"

"The view and the wind were great!"

I got it, I got it.

I got the message that you guys are strong, so please don't say anything more.

"Don't die, Ren."

"I can't guarantee that..."

"You won't fall, so it's okay. It's just shaky."

"D-Does it really shake?!"

As we were pressured even more, Rika and I were easily tied to the parachute.

Then the merciless countdown began, and with the voice saying "Go!" our feet left the deck.

"Whoaaa..."

As we swayed from side to side, we continued to rise higher into the sky.

There was a sense of fear, but it was actually not as bad as I had imagined.

"Wow, Ren-san!"

"Haa..."

Just when I thought that, Rika, who was on my left, grabbed my hand with a frightened voice.

Unlike when we usually hold hands, she tightly grasped it with a strong force.

It seems she's really scared.

However, even so, she gradually calmed down and as the shaking subsided, the strength of her grip also loosened.

By the way, when I say "usually," it's not like we hold hands often.

Seriously, I'm not lying.

"...... Wow."

"...... Haa."

Have we reached the highest point?

The parachute was completely stable, and we had regained our composure.

I waved my hand at Kyouya and Hinata on the ship with a feeling of resentment.

Then, Kyouya and Hinata showed us their hands clasped together.

"Ah...!"

I was careless...

Although they didn't know that we had held hands before...

Looking to the side, Rika also had a stunned expression on her face.

However, she still didn't let go of my hand, and we flew in the air in a pretty embarrassing state.

...Well, never mind.

"We've been caught."

"Yeah. Well, there's nothing we can do."

"...You're right."

Rika, who said that, was embarrassed but also happy, faintly smiling.

"Look, Ren-san. The city looks really small."

"Wow... From far away, it really changes your impression."

Guam's city was beautiful.

Moreover, the sea, the sky, and the coast below us were all incredibly beautiful.

"It's wonderful to be able to see this kind of scenery together, isn't it?"

"...Yeah."

At that moment, I heard Kyouya and Hinata shouting something.

They're probably making fun of us.

But from this far away, I couldn't understand what they were saying.

"...Ren-san."

"Hm?"

"...I like you, Ren-san."

"Ugh!"

What a surprise attack...!

"W-What... Why did you say that all of a sudden?"

"It's okay, isn't it? Only we can hear it. Besides, when we saw each other in swimsuits on the beach, Ren-san also..."

"Ah-ah! That story's over now!"

"...I'm worried about myself."

"...Why?"

"Because... I feel like I'm only thinking about you," Rika replied, not looking at me and staring at her trembling feet.

I couldn't help but feel happy about her confession, but I didn't say anything. Suddenly, the parachute shook again, cutting off Rika's words. We slowly descended towards the ship, and it seemed that our time was up.

From then on, until we reached the ship, Rika and I didn't say anything. This indescribable feeling of regret wasn't just because of the pleasant feeling of the sky.

Once we got back on the boat, Kyouya and Hinata teased us about holding hands, but we just laughed it off. As we were heading back to the shore, we talked about how much fun we had and how we should come back to Guam again someday.

When we arrived back on land, Susami was waiting for us. She had been relaxing and reading a book while we were up in the sky. We told her about our experience parasailing and showed her some pictures we took. She seemed a bit jealous that she missed out on the fun, but was happy for us.

As we walked back to our hotel, Rika and I walked a bit closer than usual. I couldn't help but feel happy that she had confessed her feelings to me earlier. I wondered what the future held for us, but for now, I was content just enjoying our time together.

The rest of our trip to Guam was filled with more adventures, such as snorkeling and hiking. But no matter what we did, I always had a great time with Rika and our friends.

When it was time to leave, I felt a bit sad to say goodbye to Guam and our memories there. But I knew that I would always cherish the time we spent together, and that I would always have a special place in my heart for Rika.
