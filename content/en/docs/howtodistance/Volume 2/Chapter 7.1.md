# "You were her first boyfriend"

On the second night, after dinner, there was free time. But perhaps due to fatigue from the daytime activities at the beach, everyone was noticeably more subdued than the day before. Well, it could also be because they had gotten used to the hotel.

Even so, Kyouya quickly went to hang out with his club members. Today, the usual members had separate plans.

I could say that they were all busy people, but the truth was that I also had plans to meet someone.

I took my wallet and left the room, heading to the lobby, the meeting place.

"You're here."

"...Yeah."

In the lobby, Satsuki Hinata stood, arms crossed, playing with her bright hair. She immediately ran over to me when she saw me.

"Sorry to bother you."

"I said it's okay."

We exchanged short words and left the hotel together, walking side by side towards the direction where we had previously spotted a shop.

During this free time, you were allowed to go outside within a designated area.

Hinata made a slightly more outgoing outfit than yesterday. It was impressive that she paid so much attention to her clothing.

Incidentally, I was completely in my roomwear.

"How's Rika doing?"

"She's still feeling down. She must have been looking forward to it a lot, the Sea Walker."

"...I see."

In the end, the squall from the other day stopped after several tens of minutes. But of course, Rika was still feeling down even after meeting up with Kyouya and the others.

It seemed that she was still feeling down even now.

"To cheer up Rika, I came up with a decent idea, considering it's you."

"...You're annoying."

Despite her words, Hinata's voice didn't have the usual sting to it.

And when I asked her to help me choose a gift, she easily agreed, which was surprising. I thought she would resist more.

Well, it's probably because Rika is involved.

"But why me? You would have asked Chitose instead, wouldn't you?"

"No...I originally asked Susami, but it seems he has plans."

"What? That's annoying. So, does that make me your second choice?"

Saying that, Hinata glared at me with a sharp look.

But soon she shrugged her shoulders and shook her head.

"I told Kyouya already. It would be the worst if any strange rumors started because of this."

"Yeah...so that's why you were grinning."

I thought she was giving me a particularly annoyed look, but...

"Anyway, you were staring too much at Rika's swimsuit. Your gaze was gross."

"What?! ...Are you serious?"

"Yeah. Chitose said that too."

"Ugh..."

"Well, that was a lie."

"What?!"

I was momentarily devastated...

"But it's true that your gaze was gross."

"Well...I can't deny that."

"Ew, gross."

While saying that, Hinata didn't seem as unhappy as she had initially appeared.

Rather, she seemed satisfied with teasing me, and chuckled.

Come to think of it, lately, Hinata's attitude towards me seemed to have softened significantly.

I had thought that it was because Rika was always with us, but it might not have been the case.

"So, what's the deal with Rika?"

"W-what do you mean...?"

Hinata asked, glancing at me sideways.

When I faltered, her large almond eyes narrowed again.

"Are you two getting along well?"

"Well, yeah, I think so."

"For example?"

"I-it's not like that's any of your business."

"That's not good. She's my best friend, so I worry."

Hinata's tone was surprisingly serious.

Her face wasn't smiling either.

I felt a little more self-conscious.

"...It's our first time dating."

"Huh..."

"Rika. I'm her first boyfriend."

"...I see."

Actually, Rika herself had told me about that, so I already knew.

But hearing it again like this made me feel the weight of it, or rather, the pressure.

"So, I don't want it to be a bad memory for her."

"...Yeah."

"Hey, do you really understand?"

"I...I think so."

"Haa..."

Her sigh was quite large, mixed with a dissatisfied murmur.

I wondered what she would say next, but her words were quite different from what I had expected.

"...Well, you're also inexperienced. And I can't really say anything grand either."

Her words sounded like a mutter, lost among the surrounding noise and chatter.

If you looked closely, there seemed to be a fair number of people out and about besides us.

Well, of course.

"...I was curious about something though."

"What?"

"You guys...well, you and Susami, why did you become friends with Rika?"

When I asked her, Hinata looked up at the dark night sky for a moment.

Then, she quickly turned back to me and said, with a dissatisfied tone:

"Why are you asking me? You should ask Rika."

"If I do that, I'll inevitably see things from her perspective. I want to hear your side of the story."

"...What's with that? You're so cheeky for a Kusaba."

Saying that, Hinata didn't show any sign of rejection.

I decided to keep quiet and wait, so as not to change her mind.

"...I don't know about Chitose, but..."

With that preface, Hinata began to speak slowly.
